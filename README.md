# HEALTH CARE

Health Monitoring System and Hospital Recommendation System.

Multiple diseases can be predicted simultaneously using a multi-disease prediction model. Here, a disease prediction is made based on user input. The user will be offered the option.A related disease model will be activated and predicted based on the user's given inputs if they want to predict a specific disease or if they don't enter any disease types. The benefit of using a multi-disease prediction model in advance is that it can estimate the likelihood that numerous diseases will manifest themselves while also lowering the mortality rate. Addition to that, hospital recommendation system should be added which is even easy for the users to check the nearby hospitals.
